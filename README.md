The Mission:

    The owner of a blog has contracted your security firm to test their website for vulnerabilities.

    Your mission is to hack into their blog. You suspect that you can find a user whose password is too simple. First, you need to find a registered user, and then           you're    going to attempt dozens of different common passwords.

    This would be a tedious process, but luckily, you have Burp, and its trusty Intruder tool that's built for this very purpose.


I will be taking CodePath's Cybersecurity Program in Fall 2022, and above described the pre-work we had to accomplish before being successfully enrolled. Fun intro lab in prelude of what is to come and have a better understanding of specifications and the process.
