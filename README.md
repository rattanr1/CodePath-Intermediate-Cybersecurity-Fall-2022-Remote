I will be taking CodePath's Cybersecurity Program in Fall 2022, and above described the pre-work we had to accomplish before being successfully enrolled. Fun intro lab in prelude of what is to come and have a better understanding of specifications and the process.

We had to install Burp (to view network traffic and test for security vulnerabilities) and have a PortSwigger account (maker of Burp and a cybersecurity platform).
