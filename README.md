                     #########      CodePath's Intermediate Cybersecurity Course (Fall 2022-Remote)     #########   
                     

After successfully completing the Pre-Work, I got admitted into this program where I would learn the fundamentals of cybersecurity, common application vulnerabilities and attacks, and hands-on practice to explore both offensive and defensive strategies in information security. 

With a focus on web applications security, I will learn to think like a hacker and exploit vulnerabilities, while also exploring how to build offensive capabilities into applications. 

There will be foundational knowledge of cybersecurity concepts while also applying these concepts with fun simulations replicating real-world cyber threats such has Capture The Flag (CTF), Security Shepherd, and much more.
